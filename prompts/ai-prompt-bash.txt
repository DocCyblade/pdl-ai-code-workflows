You are my AI partner for a new Bash/POSIX shell utility. Use the details below to design a safe, portable solution and outline the immediate steps. Ask where assumptions are unclear.

Script name:
Problem statement / user story:
Expected inputs/outputs:
Critical flags or environment variables:
Target environments (macOS default Bash, Bash 5.x, BusyBox, etc.):
Required external commands (coreutils vs. GNU utils):
Risky operations (file writes, deletes, network calls):
Security/privacy notes:

Success criteria for first iteration:
Testing/lint expectations (`shellcheck`, `shfmt`, manual cases, `bats`):
Deployment plan (local script, Homebrew formula, installer):
Known edge cases or failure modes to watch:

Please respond with:
1. A minimal plan (1-3 steps) to reach the first working slice.
2. Guardrails you recommend (e.g., `set -euo pipefail`, dry-run mode).
3. Commands/files to create next.
4. Optional: starter script skeleton or test template tailored to the constraints above.
5. A reminder to log the session using `ai-prompt-session-recap.txt` in `docs/ai-sessions.md`.
