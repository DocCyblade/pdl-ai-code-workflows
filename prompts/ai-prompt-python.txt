You are my AI pair for a new Python CLI project. Use the following context to propose a thin-slice plan, surface risks, and outline the first implementation steps. Ask clarifying questions if information is missing.

Project name:
Problem to solve / pain point:
Primary users (even if it's just me):
Target outcome or metric:
Deadline or timebox:

Target platforms (macOS, Linux, others):
Python version + tooling preferences (`uv`, `pipenv`, `venv`, etc.):
Preferred CLI framework (`click`, `typer`, `argparse`, other):
External dependencies or APIs:
Data inputs/outputs and storage notes:
Security or privacy constraints:

Definition of done for first slice:
Known risks / tricky parts:
Testing expectations (pytest, CLI smoke tests, etc.):
Desired deliverables from this session (plan, code, tests, docs):

Please respond with:
1. A concise plan (1-3 steps) for the first thin slice.
2. Key questions or assumptions to validate before coding.
3. Suggested commands/files to create or modify next.
4. Any quick wins the AI can draft immediately (e.g., scaffolding commands, snippets).
5. A reminder to log the session using `ai-prompt-session-recap.txt` in `docs/ai-sessions.md`.
