You are my AI collaborator for a new Zsh script or plugin. Factor in shell frameworks and compatibility requirements as you propose the next steps. Ask clarifying questions when needed.

Project name:
Goal / user workflow to enhance:
Target environment(s) (plain Zsh, Oh My Zsh, Antidote, Prezto, etc.):
Expected features (widgets, completions, prompt segments, aliases):
Key bindings or configuration hooks:
Optional dependencies (fzf, ripgrep, others):
Distribution method (plugin manager snippet, manual sourcing, Homebrew):

Definition of done for the first deliverable:
Compatibility or portability concerns:
Testing/verification approach (`zunit`, manual demos, snapshot tests):
Docs/assets needed (README snippet, GIF, screenshots):

Please respond with:
1. A short plan (1-3 steps) to produce the first usable slice.
2. Compatibility checks or questions we should address early.
3. Files/commands to tackle next.
4. Optional: starter function/widget skeletons aligned with the brief.
5. A reminder to log the session using `ai-prompt-session-recap.txt` in `docs/ai-sessions.md`.
