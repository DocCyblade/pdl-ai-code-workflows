# AI Code Workflow Library

Reference hub for solo AI-assisted coding projects. Use it to grab a high-level playbook, language-specific workflows, and prompt templates before each build session.

## Quick Links
- [AI Workflow Foundations](foundations/ai-workflow.md)
- Language Playbooks: [Python CLI](workflows/python-cli.md) · [Bash](workflows/bash.md) · [Zsh](workflows/zsh.md) · [Go CLI](workflows/go-cli.md)
- Prompt Templates: [Python](prompts/ai-prompt-python.txt) · [Bash](prompts/ai-prompt-bash.txt) · [Zsh](prompts/ai-prompt-zsh.txt) · [Go](prompts/ai-prompt-go.txt) · [Session Recap](prompts/ai-prompt-session-recap.txt)
- [Reusable Checklists & Templates](templates/README.md)

## Structure
- `foundations/` – cross-language guidance and overall AI delivery workflow.
- `workflows/` – language/framework-specific playbooks (Python, Bash, Zsh, Go, etc.).
- `prompts/` – kickoff prompts and session recap template.
- `templates/` – optional scaffolds, checklists, or reusable snippets.

## Getting Started
1. Read [foundations/ai-workflow.md](foundations/ai-workflow.md) to align on the end-to-end process.
2. Pick the relevant workflow in [workflows/](workflows) for your project type.
3. Copy a prompt from [prompts/](prompts) to prime the next AI session.
4. Capture outcomes with the [session recap template](prompts/ai-prompt-session-recap.txt) when you finish.

Add new docs where they fit best, cross-link to keep navigation quick, and extend the structure as you add more languages or project types.
